::group::Healing 'pandas': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==3.0.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the build process for `scikit-surprise` (from commit `24ed3fda8349a53455df52602d96fce435a614d0`) failing to generate metadata because the required `numpy` module is not found.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy', indicating that the package preparing its metadata in the `python3.11` environment cannot find its required 'numpy' module, observed while pip version `24.0` is in use and `26.0.1` is available.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` occurring during the package's metadata generation (handled by setuptools), meaning `numpy` is a required but missing build dependency in the environment where `pip 24.0` is performing the installation.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `numpy` package, which is required by `setuptools` to generate metadata for the package being installed within the `pip 24.0` (upgradeable to `26.0.1`) environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, which prevents the package from preparing its metadata within the Python 3.11 environment, utilizing `pip 24.0` while `pip 26.0.1` is available.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy' during package metadata generation, indicating that a required build dependency (numpy) is missing in the Python 3.11 environment while using pip version 24.0 (with 26.0.1 available).
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from the package's metadata generation process, handled by setuptools, requiring the `numpy` module, which is not found in the environment where `pip 24.0` is currently operating (with `pip 26.0.1` also noted as available).
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, a critical package required by `setuptools` during metadata generation for a project in the `python3.11` environment, which occurred while `pip 24.0` was running (with `26.0.1` available), despite pip noting it's not the cause.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because the editable package's metadata generation process, handled by `setuptools` under pip version 24.0 (with 26.0.1 available), failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, indicating `numpy` was a required build dependency but was not installed in the environment.

::group::Healing 'scipy': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.17.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict arises because the build process for `scikit-surprise` (from commit `24ed3fda8349a53455df52602d96fce435a614d0`) running under Python `3.11` requires the `numpy` module, which is not found in the environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, indicating that the package's metadata generation process for the editable package requires `numpy`, which is missing from the `python3.11` environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency issue is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy` during the package's metadata generation, preventing it from being built, with the log only mentioning pip versions `24.0` (current) and `26.0.1` (available).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy' during metadata generation, indicating the package being installed requires 'numpy' but it is not present in the environment, independently of the `pip` version (currently 24.0, with 26.0.1 available).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.16.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict originates from a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy` during the package's metadata generation, an issue distinct from the `pip` versions `24.0` and `26.0.1` noted in the log.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy' during the package's metadata generation by `setuptools`, which prevents the build process, with `pip` versions `24.0` and `26.0.1` mentioned in a separate upgrade notice.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy' during the metadata generation for an editable package, as `setuptools` requires `numpy` at build-time but it is unavailable in the environment (observed with pip `24.0` and with `26.0.1` suggested as an update).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is rooted in a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, indicating that an unspecified package requires `numpy` during its metadata generation process, but `numpy` is not installed in the Python 3.11 environment, while pip 24.0 is in use (with 26.0.1 available).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.15.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, indicating a missing build dependency required during package metadata generation, occurring within an environment where `pip` is at version `24.0` and an update to `26.0.1` is available.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.14.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'numpy', which is required by the package being installed in editable mode to generate its metadata, failing the installation attempted by pip 24.0 (with an available upgrade to 26.0.1).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.14.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict's root cause is that the package attempting to prepare editable metadata requires the `numpy` module for its build process, but `numpy` is not found in the environment, which is being handled by pip version `24.0` (with `26.0.1` available).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.13.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that the package's metadata generation process critically depends on the 'numpy' module, which is missing from the environment, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`, unrelated to the `pip` versions `24.0` (current) or `26.0.1` (available update).
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.13.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy`, indicating it's a required dependency for the package's metadata generation but is not installed in the Python 3.11 environment, while pip version 24.0 is in use and 26.0.1 is available for upgrade.
  -> Checking compatibility of scipy==1.12.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by the installation process, managed by pip (currently version 24.0, with 26.0.1 available), failing because the required `numpy` module is not found in the Python 3.11 environment during package metadata generation.
